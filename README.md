Connectome Based Predictive Modeling code based on previously validated Python code created by Dr. Fengdan Ye. Scripts were redesigned for greater flexbility in model building, prediction, and extraction of networks. Currently, all scripts have parameter settings that are set to a Shen Atlas Parcellation scheme(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23747961/) but can be updated for any atlas. This would require files similar to those contained in the ShenAtlasConfig directory here. ShenAtlasConfig files were recreated from https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/. Please see this link for amazing connectivity visualizations via a web interface. 

Repeated cross-vaidation with permutation testing is available for logistic and linear models with the ability to include covariates through partial correlations.
